<p>I think that the hardest part of this assignment to me was just 
learning my way around Github. When I am just writing the HTML code,<br>
I do fine, but commiting and pushing and making sure that the webpage is
working is brand new to me and it will take a while to get used to.</p>
<p>Learning my way around Github and Piazza were both new to me.
While I have had a bit of HTML experience, this was the first time<br>
that I did it without have my hand held, which was satisfying.</p>
<p>The Github tuturial was extremely helpful as I would have been 
completely lost without it. Piazza was also very helpful since I got to
see what other people's solutions were to similar problems.</p>
